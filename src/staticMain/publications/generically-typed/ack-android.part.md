Ack APRS Parser for Android Available Now!
==========================================

For the past several years, I've been casually developing [ACK], an APRS
packet data parser written entirely in Kotlin Multiplatform. This library
is open source, and designed for Ham radio operators to decode data from
the APRS network. The [Ack Android] app builds on this library to provide
a user friendly mobile app for receiving and transmitting APRS data.

Features
--------

The Ack APRS Android application supports both transmit and receive via
AFSK audio, Bluetooth through a TNC adapter, and Internet via APRS-IS.

Packet data is parsed and insights like weather are displayed inline for
easy analysis, as well as displayed on a map that supports location tracking.

Messaging via APRS is also supported in all modes, allowing threading with
a specific callsign or SSID.

The insights tab in the application tracks recently seen nearby weather
and station frequencies, making contact with nearby stations easier.

After years of testing, the application is available now on the Google Play
Store for a one-time purchase. I greatly appreciate the development support.
