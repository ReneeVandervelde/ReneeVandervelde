Software Projects
-----------------

### Applications

 - [Bitkey] is my primary work project at Block. It's all open source!
   Check it out!
 - [Shade] is a Kotlin SDK and CLI app built for the Phillips Hue API.
   It's one of the most comprehensive projects I've worked on and is
   well-supported. Check it out!
 - [Usonia] is my personal Home IoT controller. It's not intended for others
   to use, but I spend a lot of time working on it.
 - [ACK] and [ACK-Android] are Ham radio APRS data parsers and an application
   for displaying the data.

### KMP Libraries

 - [Spondee] is a set of classes used for expressing units of measure in Kotlin.
 - [Kimchi] is a Kotlin multiplatform logger with an API based on Timber.
 - [Watermelon] is a collection of Kotlin Multiplatform extensions.
 - [Regolith] is a collection of generic application interterfaces for
   Multiplatform projects.

### Code Audits

I'm making an effort to audit some important libraries to give
back to the open source community and help Kotlin grow.
