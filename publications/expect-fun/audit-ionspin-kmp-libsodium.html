            The
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium">kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium</a>
            library from developer
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin">Ugljesa Jovanovic</a>,
            aka ionspin, is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that gives access
            to the many cryptographic APIs of
            <a href="https://libsodium.org">Libsodium</a>.
            It currently supports most, but not all, of the platform targets
            offered by Kotlin.
        </p>
        <p>
            This library claims to be “just a wrapper around the well known Libsodium library”.
            <br />
            We’re going to test that!

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this audit was to verify the functionality in the
            kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium library. During the course of
            this audit, no major concerns were found. While there were some
            areas for improvement and monitoring in future releases, this
            library appears to do as claimed and provide access to
            Libsodium on Kotlin Multiplatform.
        </p>
        <h3>Versions Audited:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0.9.2 (<code>509d22ed0552188ced522c7304186b33fdbb8332</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About the Auditor</h2>
        <p>
            As a disclaimer up-front: This audit was done by myself in my
            personal time and was not done in a professional context.
            While I do work with some cryptography professionally, this
            audit was not done within the scope or course of my employment,
            and does not reflect the views of my employer in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my personal experience: I have been developing software for
            over 15 years. I have experience with many of the cryptographic
            APIs that Libsodium uses from a practical context. However,
            I am not a security analyst by trade, nor have I made material
            contributions to Libsodium or related cryptography libraries
            at the time of writing. I do have extensive experience with
            Kotlin Multiplatform code, making this wrapping library a good
            candidate for me to audit, since it is expected to be primarily
            a consumer of the existing Libsodium APIs adapted to
            Kotlin Multiplatform.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope and Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            For this audit I have looked at the
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/releases/tag/0.9.2">0.9.2</a>
            tag of the kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium library.
            I will update this article if and when future audits are conducted.
        </p>
        <p>
            This audit focused primarily on manual review of files, checking
            the source code for obvious errors, validating the claim that
            this is merely a wrapper of the Libsodium library, analyzing
            dependencies, and verifying the build pipeline for any suspect
            operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This audit does not put the library through any automated security
            analysis tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not an audit of Libsodium itself. This library has already
            been
            <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/libsodium-audit-results/">audited</a>
            by engineers much more qualified than me.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the purposes of this audit, the sample project included with
            the repository has not been reviewed.
        </p>
        <h2>Findings - Code Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            A wrapper library should be very straightforward to review.
            Ideally, the library would do little more than proxy calls to
            the underlying library. This can be more complex in practicality.
            The primary concerns this code analysis is focused on are:
            <br />
            Is the logic implemented in this library warranted?
            <br />
            Does the library implement parts of Libsodium on its own rather
            than deferring to the underlying library?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Libsodium methods do appear to be proxied directly to the
            underlying library as advertised. Little is done beyond
            transforming the data from a type convenient for use in Kotlin
            into the arguments needed to be provided to Libsodium.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are, however, extra utilities provided in this library that
            are not provided by Libsodium. Examples of this can include simple
            utility methods, such as the byte array extensions found in
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/blob/0.9.2/multiplatform-crypto-api/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/ionspin/kotlin/crypto/util/StringUtil.kt">StringUtil.kt</a>
            as well as supplemental properties such as transforming results
            into readable strings found in
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/blob/0.9.2/multiplatform-crypto-api/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/ionspin/kotlin/crypto/keyderivation/KeyDerivationFunction.kt#L32">ArgonResult</a>.
            While this is additional functionality on top of the wrapping
            library, these methods seem largely limited to transforming data
            for common use cases in Kotlin. These utilities aren’t typically
            used in the library itself, so they can be avoided if desired
            without affecting the functionality. I do not see any reason
            these should raise concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            One utility method of dubious quality appears in the common code
            as an extension on <code>UByteArray</code> called
            <code>fromLittleEndianUByteArrayToBigEndianUByteArray</code>.
            This method simply reverses the array. This is not sufficient
            to convert the array as claimed. This method should be avoided.
            This method does not appear to be used in the library itself
            and is only provided for convenience.
        </p>
        <h3>Area for Concern - Return Codes</h3>
        <p>
            My primary area of concern for this library is the way return
            codes from Libsodium are currently handled. While I did not
            immediately find any errors, the strategy here seems highly prone
            to error, and appears very brittle. This area deserves the
            maintainer's focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The return codes for libsodium are fairly straightforward and
            <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/quickstart#how-do-i-check-if-a-function-call-succeeded">documented</a>.
            However, in ionspin’s wrapper library, I find multiple different
            strategies for checking the return codes:
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/blob/0.9.2/multiplatform-crypto-libsodium-bindings/src/commonMain/kotlin/com.ionspin.kotlin.crypto/GeneralLibsodiumException.kt">[1]</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/blob/0.9.2/multiplatform-crypto-libsodium-bindings/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/ionspin/kotlin/crypto/secretbox/SecretBox.kt#L32-L34">[2]</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/blob/0.9.2/multiplatform-crypto-libsodium-bindings/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/ionspin/kotlin/crypto/signature/SignatureJvm.kt#L42-L44">[3]</a>.
            <br />
            Multiple of these methods are checking for a specific error code,
            rather than checking for a success code. Meaning, these methods
            may incorrectly pass should an unexpected code be returned.
            This, combined with the variance in strategies, makes this code
            very brittle and susceptible to breakage.
        </p>
        <h2>Findings - Dependency Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The wrapper library has very few external dependencies.
            This is great news for those concerned with supply chain attacks.
            The library primarily only depends on language-level
            jetbrains/kotlin dependencies directly, with a few exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary dependency of concern is a
            <a href="https://github.com/terl/resource-loader">resource-loader</a>
            library.
            This library is used by the wrapper to load the Libsodium
            <code>.so</code> files in Java. While the use case of this seems
            reasonable, this library has very few maintainers, and does
            not seem particularly widely used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second dependency for concern is the most obvious one,
            Libsodium itself. The library embeds the Libsodium library
            directly. However, in many cases the library is being built from
            a forked repository of ionspin’s as a submodule of the repository.
            This fork appears to be based on the 1.0.19 version of Libsodium.
            At the time of writing, this is only one release out of date.
            However, the snapshot has some *extra* commits included that are
            not present in Libsodium’s 1.0.19 release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Four of these extra changes (commits
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/97f7722f2c3570842709ffef5aab5e632ff4002c">97f7722</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/86a53a901aa434a139fc65a793e4d18c48d979c3">86a53a9</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/0a266e0a7d28532b6f8d97fb752bbc69ce2e86ed">0a266e0</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/ac6d3909eb0cf3d211b8137c6408ca64dd7b97b3">ac6d390</a>)
            can be verified as commits in the Libsodium repository, but were
            made after the 1.0.19 release, and are likely not verified
            independently of the subsequent release of 1.0.20. This is likely
            to include the last commit
            (<a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/ac6d3909eb0cf3d211b8137c6408ca64dd7b97b3">ac6d390</a>),
            which may fix some platform targets for apple devices. However,
            this should be updated to a tagged version of the library as
            soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last commit included in the Libsodium fork is by ionspin
            (<a href="https://github.com/ionspin/libsodium/commit/49c37e8f604b493af51d05721e4ac69f180cf925">49c37e8</a>),
            and appears to disable the Apple Vision platform as a build target.
            It’s not clear that this change was entirely necessary. It seems
            that there would be a benefit to remove this change so that the
            library can rely on an unmodified commit of Libsodium instead.
            However, the change does not appear to modify any source files
            of Libsodium itself.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall this library appears to do as claimed, and is a great
            addition to the Kotlin Multiplatform community. The project is
            not yet fully stable, but appears to be actively maintained.
            During this audit I even managed to create a
            <a href="https://github.com/ionspin/kotlin-multiplatform-libsodium/pull/46">pull-request</a>
            for a very minor bug, for which the maintainer was responsive
            and promptly merged. I hope to contribute more to the project
            as I use it more. I plan to keep an eye on future changes to
            this project, and will update findings here.
