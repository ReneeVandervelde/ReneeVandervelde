            A while back I
            <a href="https://medium.com/@ReneeVandervelde/values-not-enums-1223f85c7f7">wrote</a>
            about why I use value classes in place of enums in Kotlin.
            I still follow this practice, but have some updated notes that
            I want to share, as well as providing some additional <em>pros</em>
            for each strategy.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>The Problem With Plain Values</h2>
        <p>
            Many applications rely on plain values for options. In some
            applications, this may take the place of a string, and in others
            an integer. On Android, for example, we frequently see Integer
            constants:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)</code></pre>
        <p>
            Where the constant is defined in Android as:
        </p>
<pre class="java"><code>public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK = 268435456;</code></pre>
        <p>
            The benefit of this strategy is partially for performance. While
            the performance benefit of an int over an enum is marginal at best,
            platforms such as Android try not to make assumptions about the
            constraints on your application, and bias towards the
            more performant variant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another benefit I don't often hear talked about is API stability.
            The <code>Int</code> type is relatively universal and unbound.
            Since we're not fixed to a single set of supported values, the
            platform can easily change the value sets without needing careful
            alignment between libraries. This will become more clear when
            digging into using enums.
        </p>
        <p>
            The downside of using plain values is that it's fairly ambiguous.
            In addition to passing the pre-defined constants in, we could
            also pass <em>just about anything</em> as one of these options.
            We also lose auto-complete features much of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Android has addressed some of these deficiencies with
            annotations such as <code>@IntDef</code>, not all platforms
            are targeting Android and will rely on these. In particular,
            Kotlin Multiplatform projects often won't include these.
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem With Enums</h2>
        <p>
            Enums are frequently used as a solution to the deficiencies
            of plain values. At first glance, they seem like everything
            you want. They provide a constant set of type-safe values.
            And Sealed classes offer a similar set of values while allowing
            for multiple instances of each type.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to type safety, both Enums and sealed classes, we
            also gain exhaustive <code>when</code> statements, which are
            enforced for all sealed/enum statements as of
            <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew16.html">Kotlin 1.6</a>:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>enum class LightType { 
  LightBulb,
  LightStrip,
  FloodLight,
}

val example = when (lightType) {
  LightBulb -> ...
  LightStrip -> ...
  FloodLight -> ...
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            However, this comes with a major downside: Breaking Changes.
            <br />
            While having a bound set of values forces consumers of the API
            to update their code to match the new set of values, this is
            not always desirable. Consider the above set of types in an
            SDK. Would we really want to make a new Major/breaking release
            just to add a new product type? Probably not. Even internally,
            if your codebase is large enough, migrating all of your existing
            code may not be desirable; it may add unnecessary instability
            and a large burden to your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes we <em>want</em> the values to be unbounded, or unstable.
            Enums and Sealed Classes cannot provide this functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>The Value of Classes</h2>
        <p>
            When you want something that is unbounded like a plain value,
            but with the type-safety of a class, Kotlin has a construct
            aptly named:
            <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-classes.html">value classes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Formerly called 'inline classes', value classes wrap a plain
            value, and can be optimized by the compiler to have similar
            performance characteristics of a plain value. Because of this,
            these types also do not have the exhaustive requirements that
            sealed types and enums have.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can construct a value structure similar to an enum:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>value class LightType private constructor(
  private val type: String,
) {
  companion object {
    val LightBulb = LightType("light_bulb")
    val LightStrip = LightType("light_strip")
    val FloodLight = LightType("flood_light")
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now, when we handle that data, the type defers its identity to
            the underlying type, in this case a <code>String</code>.
            This means that Kotlin's compiler will require an <code>else</code>
            statement in exhaustive situations:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>val example = when (myLight) {
 LightBulb -> TODO()
 LightStrip -> TODO()
 FloodLight -> TODO()
 else -> TODO() // This else is *required* now
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            I want to note that this isn't <em>inherently desirable</em> either.
            Sometimes you <em>want</em> to provide a sealed type, allowing
            the consumer to rely on a fixed set of outputs. The distinction
            you should think about is whether your data type is stable or
            unbounded.
        </p>
        <h2>Simple Mistakes</h2>
        <h3>Closed vs Open</h3>
        <p>
            When I originally started using value classes like this, my
            instinct was to provide somewhat similar utility functions as
            the ones found in an enum class. for example, a
            <code>values</code> method with the known values as a collection.
            <br />
            For example:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>@JvmInline
value class LightType private constructor(
  private val type: String,
) {
  companion object {
    val LightBulb = LightType("light_bulb")
    val LightStrip = LightType("light_strip")
    val FloodLight = LightType("flood_light")

    fun values() = arrayOf(LightBulb, LightStrip, FloodLight)
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Something that's important to note about this, is that it only
            works well if your code <em>owns the data</em> that the
            value class provides. In this sense, the data is
            <strong>closed</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be a mistake to add this method if the value is
            originating from an API, for example. The distinction here is
            that not only is the data unbounded, but it is also
            <strong>open</strong>, meaning new values may appear in the
            future from the API, and we should wrap that value in this
            value class. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sense, the provided <code>val</code> definitions within
            our companion merely provide a convenient list of the current
            known values, but the values are open for new
            extensions. For this type of data, I also now recommend opening
            the constructor and key parameter:
        </p>
        <pre class="kotlin"><code>@JvmInline
value class LightType(
    val type: String,
) {
  companion object {
    val LightBulb = LightType("light_bulb")
    val LightStrip = LightType("light_strip")
    val FloodLight = LightType("flood_light")
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            This allows the same type-safety, while not causing problems
            when new values are added to the API.
