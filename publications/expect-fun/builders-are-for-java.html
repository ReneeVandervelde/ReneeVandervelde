            Are Builder classes necessary when writing in Kotlin? In a language
            like Java, builder classes are ubiquitous. Kotlin brings
            with it new data structures and methods for handling data and
            state. Do
            <a href="#">Data Classes</a>
            replace the need for Builders when using Kotlin?
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Why use a Builder at all?</h2>
        <p>
            Consider a simple Data Class in Kotlin:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>data class ConnectionConfig(
    val url: String,
    val useHttps: Boolean = true,
    val cacheResults: Boolean = false,
)</code></pre>
        <p>
            Creating new instances of this configuration works great in Kotlin
            thanks to named and default arguments:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>val myConfig = ConnectionConfig(
    url = "example.com",
    cacheResults = true,
)</code></pre>
        <p>
            This structure has several advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The end result is effectively immutable, containing only
                read-only properties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Defaults can be provided, where applicable, to the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any number of values can be specified at creation time.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is clear which parameter is being set, thanks to named
                arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It seems there is no strong need for a builder here. Why use a
            builder at all? Adding a builder would only add complexity
            while making the API less concise. That is, assuming the caller
            is using Kotlin.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if the class is being used in a Java file? For example,
            in a mixed-language project, or more likely, in an SDK. What
            would this class be like to use when the consumer is using Java?
        </p>
        <p>
            When that same call is with Java, the structure is quite
            problematic:
        </p>
<pre class="java"><code>ConnectionConfig myConfig = new ConnectionConfig(
    "example.com",
    true, // Must also be specified to specify `cacheResults`
    true,
);</code></pre>
        <p>
            Due to the way telescoping methods work in java,
            <code>cacheResults</code> can't be specified on its own anymore.
            Even when the method is annotated with <code>@JvmOverloads</code>,
            the previous arguments always need to be specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make matters worse, the primitive arguments can easily be
            confused since they are not named. When reading the code,
            it's no longer clear which boolean belongs to which parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result is an API that's tedious and error-prone. This was
            the problem that Builder classes were meant to solve.
            If the class is expected to be used by a Java caller, builders
            can still provide value for Kotlin.
        </p>
        <h2>Solving With a Builder</h2>
        <p>
            Builders are well suited to solve these problems for Java. A
            minimal implementation of a builder for this class looks like this:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>data class ConnectionConfig(
    val url: String,
    val useHttps: Boolean,
    val cacheResults: Boolean,
) {
    class Builder(
        var url: String,
    ) {
        var useHttps: Boolean = true
        var cacheResults: Boolean = false
        
        fun build() = ConnectionConfig(
            url = url,
            useHttps = useHttps,
            cacheResults = cacheResults,
        )
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now even the Java interface has a similar analogue to named and
            optional parameters:
        </p>
<pre class="java"><code>ConnectionConfig.Builder builder = new ConnectionConfig.Builder("example.com")
builder.setCacheResults(false)
ConnectionConfig myConfig = builder.build();</code></pre>
        <h3>Adding Chaining</h3>
        <p>
            The first way the builder can be improved is via the setter methods.
            Because Java lacks an <code>apply {}</code> block like Kotlin
            has, setting multiple properties can be made easier by introducing chaining
            into our methods.
            This can be done by hiding the default property setter
            and creating a function that looks more like a traditional setter
            method while returning <code>this</code> as the return type by
            using an <code>apply</code> in our Kotlin code.
            This also provides an opportunity to introduce more readable
            names to the setter methods.
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder(
    url: String,
) {
    var url: String = url
        private set // Hide the default setters from public
    var useHttps: Boolean = true
        private set
    var cacheResults: Boolean = false
        private set

    fun setUrl(value: String): Builder = apply {
        url = value
    }

    fun useHttps(value: Boolean): Builder = apply {
        useHttps = value
    }

    fun cacheResults(value: Boolean): Builder = apply {
        cacheResults = value
    }

    fun build() = ConnectionConfig(
        url = url,
        useHttps = useHttps,
        cacheResults = cacheResults,
    )
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Now the Java calls are much cleaner, thanks to the chaining:
        </p>
<pre class="java"><code>ConnectionConfig myConfig = new ConnectionConfig.Builder("example.com")
    .setCacheResults(false)
    .build();</code></pre>
        <h3>Copy Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Kotlin's data classes also benefit from easy copy modification
            via generated <code>copy</code> methods. Interestingly, Java
            does have access to these methods, but it suffers from the same
            lack of named arguments and optional parameters that the
            constructors have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, this can be solved by adding a <code>toBuilder</code>
            method to our class that transforms the class <em>back into</em>
            a builder class.
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>data class ConnectionConfig(
    val url: String,
    val useHttps: Boolean,
    val cacheResults: Boolean,
) {
    class Builder(
        var url: String,
    ) { /* ... */ }

    fun toBuilder() = Builder(url)
        .useHttps(useHttps)
        .build()
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now callers can convert to and from the builder to create new
            modified instances of the class.
        </p>
<pre class="java"><code>ConnectionConfig myConfig = new ConnectionConfig.Builder("example.com")
    .setCacheResults(false)
    .build();

ConnectionConfig newConfig = myConfig.newBuilder()
    .setUrl("modified.example.com")
    .build();</code></pre>

        <h2>Pitfalls</h2>
        <h3>Don't put properties in the builder's constructor</h3>
        <p>
            It's tempting to try to use Kotlin's language features to avoid
            some of the boilerplate in this builder, such as moving the
            properties of the builder class into its default constructor and
            relying on Kotlin's generated <code>set</code> methods:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder(
    var url: String,
    var useHttps: Boolean = true,
    var cacheResults: Boolean = false,
) { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
        <p>
            This is <strong>not recommended</strong> because the java callers
            would no longer have access to chaining when calling <code>set</code>
            methods, and would need to provide multiple arguments at a time,
            even when not desired.
        </p>
        <h3>Put required arguments in the builders constructors</h3>
        <p>
            One common anti-pattern with builders is to instead check
            requirements at runtime during the <code>build()</code> call.
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder {
    var url: String? = null
        private set

    fun setUrl(value: String) = apply {
        url = value
    }

    fun build(): ConnectionConfig {
        requireNotNull(url) { "URL is required" } // Don't do this

        return ConnectionConfig(url)
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            This is <strong>not recommended</strong> because it introduces
            a <em>runtime error</em> for something that could be caught
            at compile-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the properties themselves should not be put in the builder's
            default constructor. Required <em>arguments</em> should be in the
            default constructor. In other words, while the constructor for
            the builder should not contain <code>var</code>/<code>val</code>
            lines, anything required should be specified as a plain argument:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder(
    url: String, // Required argument, not a property.
) {
    var url: String = url // The argument is passed to the property here.
    /* ... */
}
    </code></pre>
        <h3>Allow continued modification</h3>
        <p>
            In an application, builders are often passed around as the data
            is being built, being copied and mutated until it is ready to
            be passed into an API. The ability to have a data structure
            temporarily modifiable, and then finalized with a <code>build</code>
            call is one of the arguments to use a builder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>set</code> methods should always be accessible on the
            builder class, even if the property was required in the
            construction of the builder:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder(
    url: String,
) {
    var url: String = url
        private set

    // This method should be defined, even though url was required
    fun setUrl(value: String): Builder = apply {
        url = value
    }

    /* ... */
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            This also applies to <em>optional</em> properties. A common
            mistake is to make the setter for an optional property non-null.
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>class Builder {
    var exampleOption: String? = null
        private set

    fun setExampleOption(value: String) { // Don't do this
        exampleOption = value
    }
    /* ... */
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The problem with this is that the option can not be set
            back to <code>null</code> after it is specified.
            If <code>null</code> is a valid option, it should be able
            to be specified explicitly. This allows the user to set the
            parameter dynamically from another property without requiring
            an <code>if</code> statement to conditionally call our setter,
            and break the chaining.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Result</h2>
        <p>
            All of these strategies brought together results in a bit of
            boilerplate, but works well on all platforms:
        </p>
<pre class="kotlin"><code>data class ConnectionConfig(
    val url: String,
    val useHttps: Boolean,
    val cacheResults: Boolean,
) {
    fun toBuilder() = Builder(url)
        .useHttps(useHttps)
        .build()

    class Builder(
        url: String,
    ) {
        var url: String = url
            private set // Hide the default setters from public
        var useHttps: Boolean = true
            private set
        var cacheResults: Boolean = false
            private set

        fun setUrl(value: String): Builder = apply {
            url = value
        }

        fun useHttps(value: Boolean): Builder = apply {
            useHttps = value
        }

        fun cacheResults(value: Boolean): Builder = apply {
            cacheResults = value
        }

        fun build() = ConnectionConfig(
            url = url,
            useHttps = useHttps,
            cacheResults = cacheResults,
        )
    }
}</code></pre>
