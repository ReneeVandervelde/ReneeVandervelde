            Firefox doesn't seem to respect the "open previous windows"
            setting when the browser is closed for a restart. As someone
            who likes to start from a clean slate, this was frustrating
            me quite a bit. I decided to fix it the hard way.

        <h2>Tabs Restoring is a Known Bug in Firefox</h2>
        <p>
            There is a
            <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1604709">
                bug report
            </a>
            in Mozilla's tracker describing this exact issue. inexplicably,
            however, the bug is closed as "invalid" with a comment that
            describes the issue, but provides no workaround or justification
            for the behavior, instead simply stating why the bug happens.
        </p>
        <h2>Automatically Deleting Previous Sessions on Startup</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to fix this myself, admittedly in a hacky way. What
            I did is create a service that runs on startup and deletes the
            previous session store files. This is potentially dangerous, so
            proceed at your own risk, but it works for me at the time of
            writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The session store files are located in Firefox's profile
            directory, which can be found by going to <code>about:support</code>.
            Using the directory in that, the <code>find</code> command can
            be used to delete files within any profiles' <code>sessionstore-backups</code>
            folder. I am running Fedora/Linux, so mine is located in
            <code>$HOME/.mozilla/firefox</code>. The following code should
            be modified to match your system directory:
        </p>
<pre class="shell"><code>find "$HOME/.mozilla/firefox" -path "*/sessionstore-backups/*" -type f -print -exec rm -f "{}" \;</code></pre>
        <p>
            All you need to do is put this in a bash script to run at Startup.
            In Fedora/linux, this can be done with a systemd service:
        </p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Delete Firefox Sessions

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -l -c 'exec "$@"' _ find "$HOME/.mozilla/firefox" -path "*/sessionstore-backups/*" -type f -print -exec rm -f "{}" \;

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target</code></pre>
        <p>
            Other systems may follow the same pattern in whatever startup
            mechanism they choose, so long as the script is run before
            Firefox launches.
