            Over the years, I've begun to recognize scenarios in which
            feature flags have become a bad habit in projects. While there
            are some good use cases for feature flags, I have found them to
            be less useful in practice than the industry would seem to suggest.
            At their worst, they can be outright harmful to a project.

            Firefox doesn't seem to respect the "open previous windows"
            setting when the browser is closed for a restart. As someone
            who likes to start from a clean slate, this was frustrating
            me quite a bit. I decided to fix it the hard way.

            An explanation of why I'm moving my articles to my own website,
            rather than rely on a platform like Medium or Substack.
