            An explanation of why I'm moving my articles to my own website,

            Firefox doesn't seem to respect the "open previous windows"
            setting when the browser is closed for a restart. As someone
            who likes to start from a clean slate, this was frustrating
            me quite a bit. I decided to fix it the hard way.
