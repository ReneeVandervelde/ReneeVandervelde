            In the last few years I've begun to recognize scenarios in which
            feature flags have become a bad habit in projects. While there
            are some good use cases for feature flags, I have found them to
            be less useful in practice than the industry would seem to suggest.
            At their worst, they can be outright harmful to a project.

        <h2>Feature Flags Maximize Work-In-Progress</h2>
        <p>
            The most problematic habit that I've seen develop in projects
            using feature flags is using them as a way to covertly roll-over
            work between development cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Development cycles, such as Sprints, are a way to minimize the
            amount of in-progress work that a team has. Their purpose is to
            ensure that the application frequently hits milestones in which
            the project is <em>shipable</em>. Until a feature is 
            <em>actually</em> shipped to the customer, no value been delivered,
            and the work is still accumulating unplanned work and technical
            debt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feature Flags conveniently enable developers to side-step these
            processes by 'shipping' code that is never actually used by 
            customers. That is, until the day the feature flag is enabled
            and months of work suddenly hit production at once. Problems 
            quickly arise and bugs flood and slam your engineering team with
            unplanned work, grinding your development velocity to a halt.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my biggest pet peeves in development processes is how
            often teams are willing to <em>lie to themselves</em> about what
            they're actually doing. People love to <em>say</em> that they're
            an agile team, or that they work in a Scrum process. But, more
            often than not, what they mean is they scheduled a stand-up 
            meeting. Because, after all, that was the easiest part of the 
            process. Agile development is <strong>hard</strong>, and it
            requires discipline. Feature flags allow you to break that 
            discipline. You're lying to yourself, this is a
            <strong>waterfall</strong> process. Meeting every two weeks to
            discuss how the project is going doesn't make your team agile.
