            I decided to stop publishing to my
            <a href="https://medium.com/@ReneeVandervelde">Medium Account</a>.
            I'm not planning to delete the account; the content that is there
            will remain. However, I will not be continuing to
            post there.
</p><p>Instead, I'm starting a section on my website for
            <a href="https://reneevandervelde.com/publications">Publications</a>.
            I want to start by posting a little about this decision, both
            to explain and to remind my future self why I am here.

        <h2>Visibility vs Trust</h2>
        <p>
            Publishing to a platform like Medium or Substack can give your
            posts a lot of visibility. The platform can push your content
            in the feed and associated articles, bringing new readers to
            your publication. This is appealing, as I want people to read
            what I write.
        </p>
        <p>
            What you lose with this algorithmic feed is trust. The feed
            will push whatever posts it can in front of users, regardless
            of your affiliation with the writer, and whether that information
            is valuable or trusted. I don't find this approach to sharing
            information valuable as a reader, and so I hesitate to participate
            in it as a writer. I want to focus on creating a tighter
            <em>circle of trust</em> in my writing.
        </p>
        <h2>Platform Rot</h2>
        <p>
            At the time of writing, internet platforms are undergoing
            a sort of transformation. Investment money isn't being poured
            into platforms as in recent years, and many established
            platforms are scrambling to find profits in business models
            that may not be profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, many platforms are now
            <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddits-plan-to-kill-third-party-apps-sparks-widespread-protests/">closing off APIs</a>,
            <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779764/twitter-blocks-unregistered-users-account-tweets">walling-off content</a>
            and
            <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/youtube-limits-ad-blocker-usage-in-new-test/">increasing advertising efforts</a>.
            As this happens I grow increasingly worried about link rot
            in my own content, the general experience of the platform changing,
            as well as the increasingly likely possibility that my content
            will sit on a platform that has largely been abandoned anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving my writing to my own site allows me to control all
            of these concerns. Though I am well aware that my posts will
            have far less visibility and readership than on a platform like
            Medium or Substack would.
        </p>
        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The design for my publications is intentionally simple. I don't
            want the burden of maintaining the site to be very high.
            Moreover, I don't need any distractions here. I am not trying
            to keep you on the platform by suggesting your next article.
            I don't need flashy branding. I only want somewhere to write.
            Aside from some basic navigation, that's all that's here.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first publication is called Expect Fun, and it's a series
            on Multiplatform Kotlin development. You can read the
            <a href="../expect-fun/values-and-enums.html">first article</a>
            now, which is a rehash of my thoughts on value classes and enums,
            which I've revised slightly since writing about it previously.
